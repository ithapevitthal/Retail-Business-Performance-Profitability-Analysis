# Retail-Business-Performance-Profitability-Analysis
# 🛒 Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **retail transactional data** to uncover insights on sales, profitability, customer behavior, and seasonal demand.  
It integrates multiple tools to provide a complete end-to-end solution:  
- **SQL** for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis  
- **Python** (Pandas, Jupyter) for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and validation  
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards  
- **Zoho Analytics** for advanced visualization and anomaly detection  

The final output helps retailers **optimize product strategies, promotions, and customer engagement**.  
## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies  
- SQL (MySQL)  
- Python (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook)  
- Power BI  
- Zoho Analytics  
- Dataset: `Retail_with_categories.csv`  
## 📊 Key Features  
✔️ Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling nulls, duplicates, recalculations)  
✔️ Transformation using SQL views, functions, and stored procedures  
✔️ Exploratory analysis of **seasonal trends, product categories, and profitability**  
✔️ Detection of **anomalies in profit and sales**  
✔️ Visual dashboards for:  
   - Seasonal sales & revenue trends  
   - Top-performing products & categories  
   - Discount & promotion impact  
   - Store-type performance  
   - Customer basket size analysis

📈 Results & Insights

Seasonal variations strongly influence revenue and profit.

Certain product categories dominate profitability, while others underperform.

Discounts boost sales but may lower profit margins if not applied strategically.

Customer segmentation reveals high-value buyers with larger basket sizes.

Store-type performance and payment method analysis support operational decisions.
